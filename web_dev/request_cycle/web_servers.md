Key Linux Design Philosophy:

Small is Beautiful
-The commands are short and small

Each Program Does One Thing Well
-Made for one specific task

Choose Portability Over Efficiency / Use Shell Scripts to Increase Leverage and Portability
-Shell Scripts are faster that a program compiled in a language

Store Data in Flat Text Files
-Easy, fast and simple

Use Software Leverage
-Somebody already wrote tons of things in C that we can easily use now

WHAT IS A VPS?
-I would say it is a place to contact that is tipically not your own computer. It can be a chunk of memory from a computer in Europe, that you can contact and use to host files like HTTP and CSS and be the bridge for you to acess it elsewhere.

ADVANTAGES OF VPS:
-Less expansive than something fully dedicated for whatever you are doing, can be customized for your needs and you have more control over it.

NICE DOM PROPERTIES:
Element.animate() 
- Seems to be a good user feedback

Element.requestFullscreen()
- For creating a video player, for example

object.style.display
- to check the element's display type
display:none
- to hides the entire element
visibility:hidden
- to hide the contents of the element
