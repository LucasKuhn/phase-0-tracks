# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* Version Control is a way to save the changes made to a file, 
* and it is very useful because you can go back to a previous 
* version and discuss a specific change before it is applied.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* A branch is a "copy" of something that you create, usually 
* to add a specific feature without editing the original source.
* You would use it so you don't screw up the master branch and 
* it gives you more freedom to try new things and check with others
* before inserting that feature you worked on back on the main thing. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* A commit is a change that was made and published. 
* A good commit message is short and precise!
* What is a merge conflict?
* A merge conflict is when Git doesn't know what changes should be
* made to the master branch. It happens for example when two branches
* make different changes to the same thing.
