# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* Version Control is a way to save the changes made to a file, 
* and it is very useful because you can go back to a previous 
* version and discuss a specific change before it is applied.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* A branch is a "copy" of something that you create, usually 
* to add a specific feature without editing the original source.
* You would use it so you don't screw up the master branch and 
* it gives you more freedom to try new things and check with others
* before inserting that feature you worked on back on the main thing. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* A commit is a change that was made and published. 
* A good commit message is short and precise!
* What is a merge conflict?
* A merge conflict is when Git doesn't know what changes should be
* made to the master branch. It happens for example when two branches
* make different changes to the same thing.
* [Extra answer for a question that doesn't even exist: Glenna, since I'm taggin you here anyway just wanted to say thanks for being so nice in our Intro Session and if you read this when you come back from you out of office hour, hope you had lots of fun! :D]
